Tricle calculator helps you to calculate radii of various circles related to a triangle:
- Incircle: Largest circle that fits entirely inside the triangle and is tangent to all three sides. Incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle meet.
- Circumcircle: The unique circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle. Circumcenter is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle's sides meet.
- Orthocircle: It is the circle that passes through the triangle's orthocenter (intersection of altitudes).
- Nine-point Circle: The nine-point circle is a circle that passes through nine significant points of a triangle - the midpoints of the three sides, the feet of the altitudes and the midpoints of the line segments connecting the orthocenter to the triangle's vertices.
- Excircle: An excircle is a circle that lies outside the triangle and is tangent to one of its sides and the extensions of the other two sides. Each triangle has three excircles, each associated with one of its sides


How to run the calculator -> Please run the python script "run_calculator.py"
